#Setup
Pick one member of the team to own the repository and pipeline. That person should do the following:

Click the "Use this template" button above (see GitHub's docs) to create your team repository and name it something appropriate for your project.
In your repo, click the "Deploy to Heroku" button at the top of the README and create a Heroku account when prompted.
Fill in the name of the application, select Europe and then click "Deploy App".
Once it has deployed successfully, click the "Manage app" button to view the application details.
Go to the "Deploy" tab, select "Connect to GitHub" and choose your repo.
Click "Enable automatic deploys".
Whenever you commit to main (or e.g. merge a pull request) it will get automatically deployed!

You should now make sure all of the project team are collaborators on the repository.

#Scripts
Various scripts are provided in the package file, but many are helpers for other scripts; here are the ones you'll commonly use:

dev: starts the frontend and backend in dev mode, with file watching (note that the backend runs on port 3100, and the frontend is proxied to it).
lint: runs ESLint and Prettier against all the code in the project.
serve: builds and starts the app in production mode locally.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
